To a higher degree, the quality and effectiveness of the learning depends on student motivation and involvement. Sometimes, there are too many problems with students in classes such as not enough time finishing their studies or courses. Students also find it hard to manage their study time, which can lead to them quitting or not doing well in school. This is where a virtual assistant like voice assistant can be useful. Voice assistants are devices or applications that use voice recognition technology, natural language processing, and AI to respond to people. Initially, virtual assistants referred to online support professionals. The process of a voice assistant involves three steps: converting speech to text, understanding the meaning of the text, and taking action accordingly. His framework serves as the basis for effectively communicating with users in natural language. Our voice assistant system is an early attempt to use them for educational purposes. This system provides a simple voice response interface without the need for the users to find information in complex web pages or app menus. With the help of this system, students can quickly access their coursework information.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/ai-enabled-voice-assistant/","summary":"Intro Education is one of the most important aspects of human development, greatly influencing the path of professional development and success.
