[{"content":"Intro Ayomomo is a UK-based web platform created for Nepali restaurants specializing in authentic dumplings (momo). It was initiated by UK based Nepali chef Binod Baral. Many Nepalese living UK miss the authentic taste of their comfort food, and Ayomomo solves this by providing genuine momo that taste like home.The goal of this project is connecting the Nepalese community to their culture as well as introduce Nepali cuisine to international food lovers.\nüõ† Tech Stack Backend: Django (Python), Django REST Framework (DRF) Cloud Services: AWS EC2 (hosted backend), S3 (for static/media files), CloudFront (CDN) Deployment: Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD Database: PostgreSQL (via AWS RDS) Task Queue: Celery + Redis (for background jobs) ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Restaurant Flow Sign Up: Restaurants register using a form, providing details like restaurant name, business phone number, location, and logo. Approval: Admin reviews and approves the restaurant. Menu Management: Once approved, restaurants can post their menu items and prices. Order Notifications: When customers place orders, restaurants receive emails for each food item ordered, ensuring they prepare the correct items. Customer Flow Sign Up \u0026amp; Verification: Customers register via a form with OTP email verification (handled asynchronously by Celery) or Google Sign-In. Browse Restaurants: After account creation, customers can browse and choose nearby restaurants. Place Orders: Customers place orders, selecting either delivery (cash on delivery) or pickup. Multi-Restaurant Orders: Customers can order from multiple restaurants in a single order. They receive a single consolidated email with all items, while each restaurant receives emails only for their specific items. Key Features / Backend Handling Multi-vendor support: Each restaurant manages its menu and receives orders independently. OTP verification \u0026amp; email notifications: Managed asynchronously using Celery. Delivery vs pickup: Flexible ordering options for customers. Order management: Ensures correct email notifications to restaurants and customers. üöÄ Final Thoughts Ayomomo was a full-stack project that helped me bring together modern web development skills‚Äîfrom backend architecture to cloud deployment. I gained hands-on experience with DevOps (CI/CD), asynchronous task management, and scalable application design.\nThis project reflects my ability to:\nBuild and deploy a production-ready backend system Architect cloud-based, scalable infrastructure Combine clean design with performance-first development practices Next steps includes:\nImplementing a real-time order management system Integrating Stripe for online payments ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/ayomomo/","summary":"Intro Ayomomo is a UK-based web platform created for Nepali restaurants specializing in authentic dumplings (momo).

To a higher degree, the quality and effectiveness of the learning depends on student motivation and involvement. Sometimes, there are too many problems with students in classes such as not enough time finishing their studies or courses. Students also find it hard to manage their study time, which can lead to them quitting or not doing well in school. This is where a virtual assistant like voice assistant can be useful. Voice assistants are devices or applications that use voice recognition technology, natural language processing, and AI to respond to people. Initially, virtual assistants referred to online support professionals. The process of a voice assistant involves three steps: converting speech to text, understanding the meaning of the text, and taking action accordingly. His framework serves as the basis for effectively communicating with users in natural language. Our voice assistant system is an early attempt to use them for educational purposes. This system provides a simple voice response interface without the need for the users to find information in complex web pages or app menus. With the help of this system, students can quickly access their coursework information.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/ai-enabled-voice-assistant/","summary":"Intro Education is one of the most important aspects of human development, greatly influencing the path of professional development and success.
