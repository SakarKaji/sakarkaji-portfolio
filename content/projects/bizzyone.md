## Intro

[**Bizzyone**](https://www.bizzyone.com/) is an online marketplace for commercial real estate which provides a platform where buyers, sellers, agents, and admins interact seamlessly.

In Nepal, real estate pricing is highly inconsistent, with sellers often quoting random rates and brokers charging excessive commissions and this lack of transparency creates confusion, mistrust, and unfair deals for both buyers and sellers. 

Bizzyone solves this by providing a transparent, standardized, and centralized platform for real estate transactions.
